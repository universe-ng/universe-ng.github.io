        <p>
          UniVerse is a campus-focused social platform created by Nigerian
          university students to support meaningful communication within
          university communities.
        </p>

        <p style="margin:20px 0;">
          Many students currently rely on general social networks that are not
          designed around campus life. This often leads to fragmented
          discussions, limited relevance, and concerns around privacy and
          community control.
        </p>

        <p>
          UniVerse was developed to provide a more focused environment where
          students can interact around shared academic spaces, interests, and
          campus experiences.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color:var(--accent);margin:30px 0 16px;">Platform principles</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Participation centered around individual university communities</li>
          <li>Optional anonymous posting for selected features</li>
          <li>Topic-based channels for academics and student life</li>
          <li>Stories for short-lived, casual sharing</li>
          <li>Designed with student privacy and simplicity in mind</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="margin-top:30px;">
          UniVerse is currently being piloted in selected universities, with
          gradual expansion planned to additional campuses over time.
        </p>
