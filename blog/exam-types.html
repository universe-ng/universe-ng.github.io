      <p>Exam season in a Nigerian university is not just about books. It is a movie. 🎬</p>
      
      <p>Whether you are in UDUS, UNILAG,BUK, or ABU, the characters are always the same. As we prepare for the next semester, let's recognize the 5 legends you will definitely see in the hall.</p>

      <hr style="border: 0; border-top: 1px solid var(--border); margin: 30px 0;">

      <h3>1. The "Lord of the Sheets" 📄</h3>
      <p>We have not even spent 30 minutes, and this person is already raising their hand shouting, <em>"Invigilator! Extra sheet please!"</em></p>
      <p>You will be looking at your own empty paper wondering if you are writing the same exam. What are they writing? Are they rewriting the Bible? These people are the reason for our high blood pressure.</p>

      <h3>2. The "Giraffe" 🦒</h3>
      <p>This guy has a neck mechanism that defies biology. He is sitting in Row 3, but his eyes are reading answers from Row 1.</p>
      <p>He doesn't talk. He doesn't move his body. Only the neck extends. If the invigilator catches him, he will pretend he is looking at the ceiling fan for "inspiration."</p>

      <h3>3. The "Prayer Warrior" 🙏</h3>
      <p>They spend the first 15 minutes binding and casting principalities and powers. They will anoint their pen, anoint the table, and speak in tongues.</p>
      <p><strong>Reality Check:</strong> Unless the Holy Spirit studied GST 101, you still need to read your books o!</p>

      <h3>4. The "Format" Guy (The Magician) 🎩</h3>
      <p>He walks in with confidence but no knowledge. He has written answers on his thigh, inside his calculator cover, and arguably on his fingernails.</p>
      <p>He is always sweating, even if the AC is on. If an invigilator walks near him, he freezes like a statue.</p>

      <h3>5. The "I Just Want to Pass" Gang 😴</h3>
      <p>This group (most of us) just wants a 'C' and peace of mind. We write what we know, shade the rest, and submit. "La cram, La pour, La forget."</p>

      <hr style="border: 0; border-top: 1px solid var(--border); margin: 30px 0;">

      <p><strong>Which one are you?</strong> Or did we miss a category?</p>
      
      <p>Don't suffer in silence this semester. Join your departmental channel on <strong>UniVerse</strong> to find study partners (so you don't have to be the Giraffe).</p>
